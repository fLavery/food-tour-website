## Dingle Food Tour Website
Stream One Project: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

This website was built for a person who is running a business where she takes people on a tour of Dingle town, Co. Kerry, where they are informed of local history and try out interesting and unusual food practices of the area. The site should allow prospective customers find out information such as tour type, dates and prices. As well as this customers should be able to send enquiries and book a food tour of various types.
The tour operator also has a food and lifestyle instagram page which she would like to promote on the page.
 
## UX
These are eth user stories I came up with for the website:

- As a user I want to be able to use the website easily on a variety or devices.
 
- As a user I want to be able to book a tour at a certain time, on a certain date so that I can experience a food tour.

- As a user I want to find the details of the tour and the guide so I can know which tour would suit my tastes.

- As a user I want to be able to contact the tour guide, if there is any information I wish to knkow that isn't contained on the site.

The primary goal of the site was to get bookings for the food tour operator. With this in mind I designed the website so that the user was immediately presented with what the purpose of the site was and also a way they could book a tour. 
A small blurb on each tour type is in the next section after a small scroll, where users can link to a section on the same page where they can get a fuller description of the tour and prices.
I also wanted to make sure that no matter where a user was on the page, they could easily get back to the booking section so I included a fixed "Book Now" button to return them immediately to the booking section.

## Features

- Scoll to different sections on clicking links
